*Coming soon*

# Syntax for the author file
The syntax for the author file can be found at the top of the template file included in the repo. It should look like this:
```
name_short|Name|Username|email
```

# Why?
Writing co-authors onto commits can be pretty tedious so automating this process as a simple shell alias is a lot nicer

# Workflows
This repo is sort of a test bed for working with Dagger CI but therefore also should support automated testing and building at some point 
*coming soon*
